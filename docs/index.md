# For Users (Homebrewers)
## Quickstart
You'll need all the hardware listed in the [hardware section](hardware.md), and a image of Adaptibrew (a version of raspbian). Everything will come installed on the raspberry pi, but will need to be updated. Do that with this command:
```
$ pip install llamicron_weber --upgrade
```
Then run weber with `python -m weber.weber`
